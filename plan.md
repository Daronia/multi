# Backlog


## Open
* Each time the user enters the game screen a new, random exercise is created.
* The user gets a nicley designed startup screen
* The user gets a nicley designed game screen

## In Progress
* On the game screen I see one excercise and have to enter the correct solution to proceed. The Page gives feedback whether the soulution is correct.

## Done
* I can launch the game in the browser, click on the start game link on the home screen and proceed to the game screen
    * Manually Confirmed: 2012-06-19 A start screen is shown containing a menu link into the game screen. (Selenium candidate)





## Rejected

* *The state (are we at the start view or within the game) is maintained by a view model instead of html.* This is a technical issue and totally transparent to the user. The user doesn't care and so should we. However, *if* there is a technical reason to maintain state the described way, we should integrate it in a refactoring.
